***Overfitting:***

When do we say that overfitting has happened?

In some situations, the model works perfectly on train data and it has high accuracy, however, it has low accuracy in valid and test data! In these situations, we say the model has been overfitted!
Solution

Some methods to avoid overfitting

   - Cross-validation
   - Train with more data
   - Remove features
   - Adding drop out
   - Early stopping
   - Regularization
